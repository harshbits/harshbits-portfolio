                Excellent results can be achieved through agility.
                Therefore I try to empower the agile concept in any aspects of life.
                I believe that brilliant software can only be achieved through constant feedback and an open mind.
                Self-organization of teams triggers creativity.

                Through working experience, I have become an expert on Scrum.
                I have worked with JIRA, Confluence and classic tools like post-its.
